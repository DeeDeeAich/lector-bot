This is educational software pursuant to [Section 107 of the Copyright Act](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107) of the United States. The lectionaries are the works of their respective owners, and copies of the lectionaries themselves are NOT included in the software. The software is similiar in function to an RSS feed reader, merely providing abridged previews of the daily lectionaries as they appear on their respective websites. Notices and citations to the lectionaries have hence been included in the software ex fide bona.
